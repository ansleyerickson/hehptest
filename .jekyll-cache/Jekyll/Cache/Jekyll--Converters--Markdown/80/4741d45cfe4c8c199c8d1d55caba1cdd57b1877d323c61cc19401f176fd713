I"ET<p class="p1">The All-Day Neighborhood School Program sought to transform elementary schools through a wide range of components that impacted the school day and afterschool time. Most importantly, it would provide continuity between students home and school lives and communities. These changes affected curriculum, staffing, scheduling, and the school environment. Ellen Lurie, an education activist who served on the local school board that oversaw P.S. 194 in the 1960s, wrote, "No statistical report can possibly catch the liveliness and excitement that pervades the atmosphere of these schools."</p>

<p>HEADER Existing Opportunities for Harlem Youth</p>

<p>Harlem’s youth population needed strong schools as well as other ways to develop through play, learning, and community. Advocates for the All-Day Neighborhood Schools and other educational reforms in Harlem stressed the lack of recreational activities for youth and a concern that free time “in the streets” led to crime and delinquency. While this may have been true for some children, there were a number of existing institutions in Harlem that already offered activities outside of school. Both formal and informal, these programs were envisioned and run by members of the Harlem community.</p>

<p>“In <em>Race and Real Estate: Conflict and Cooperation in Harlem, 1890-1920</em>, Kevin McGruder argues that the establishment of educational and recreational spaces was one way that the emerging black community in Harlem was ““seeking to form a community of some permanence that they hoped would thrive.”” In the early 20th century, Harlem residents established their own youth institutions in the face of exclusion from other New York City organizations. They believed that opportunities for youth in arts, athletics, and leadership activities would strengthen the entire community.</p>

<p>Two of the first institutions to open in Harlem were the YMCA and the YWCA. Formed as branches of national organizations only open to white membership, these buildings were spaces for older youth, primarily serving as residences for young adults moving to Harlem from the South during the Great Migration. Over time, they also developed afterschool activities for children. At the YWCA on 137th Street, young girls could join Girl Reserves, similar to Girl Scouts, where they participated in activities designed to foster strong values and leadership. The building also served as a place where neighborhood children could drop by after school and participate in art projects, field trips, educational discussions, theater, and games. By 1938 the YWCA had 1,200 junior members.

<p>Harlem youth also participated in athletic activities. As early as 1900, private athletic clubs opened throughout Harlem, with basketball, track and field, and boxing groups. Members paid dues to join a team and competed regularly. For the most part, these institution were only opened to boys and young men. Basketball, in particular, flourished in Harlem with many opportunities for youth to play formally and informally after school and on the weekends. Beginning in 1947, Holcombe Rucker, a playground director from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation developed an extensive youth basketball program out of Harlem's public parks and playgrounds. He set up teams and tournaments in the 1950s and 1960s. Rucker also mentored the youth he worked with and offered tutoring, alongside athletics.

<p>In addition to these community programs outside of the school, Harlem teachers and administrators created their own innovative programs within the public school system. At P.S. 24 on 128th Street, Principal Gertrude Ayer was a leader in the experimental activity program of the 1930s, which brought a progressive curriculum centering interdisciplinary projects, self-direction, and problem solving. Ayer created special opportunities at her school that welcomed in families, cared for them, and integrated the school into the community. Similarly, P.S. 89 on 135th Street served as a recreational and social center after school with clubs, classes, and meeting spaces. It became the Lenox Community Center, and was open to the community as well as to children from the school. In many ways, these initiatives mirrored aspects of the All-Day Neighborhood School program, but they were more a function of individual's philosophies and dedication rather than a formalized program.</p>

<p>While these institutions, and others, offered varied opportunities for youth engagement outside of school, they had limited resources and could not be available to all children in Harlem. The All-Day Neighborhood School would bring another option for needed childcare and education. Yet by focusing on the school space, it ignored other community programs already a part of Harlem.</p>"

HEADER P.S. 194 and Harlem Schools in 1942

<p>When P.S. 194 became an All-Day Neighborhood School in 1942 it was only two years old. Opened in 1940 after two years of construction, P.S. 194 was one of a few schools to be built in Harlem after 1935, responding to serious overcrowding in classrooms. In an <em>Amsterdam News</em> article announcing the approval of its funding, Gertrude Ayer, principal of P.S. 24 in Harlem and the first African American female principal in New York City, was quoted saying,
<blockquote>
<p><em>""It has taken our community a long time to convince the Board of Education and the members of the Board of Estimate that whatever may be true of Manhattan and its declining population is not the case with Harlem. Our community is one of growing population and additional school and recreational facilities should and must be provided to meet our expanding needs.""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S. 194 opened and became an All-Day Neighborhood School in the midst of debates by activists, educators, and city officials about the future of schooling in Harlem.</p>"

"&lt;h3 style=""text-align: left;""&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 style=""text-align: left;""&gt;Who Attended P.S. 194?&lt;/h3&gt;

<p>While there is little recorded about P.S. 194's first years, its student body consisted of children from the surrounding neighborhood. In 1940 a school administrator reported student nationalities to the Board of Education, listing 1,029 African American students whose fathers were born in the United States, and 320 whose fathers were born in the West Indies.</p>

<p>P.S. 194's population reflects the fact that by 1940, with migration from the South and the West Indies as well as movement north from other parts of Manhattan, the majority of Harlem's population was black. Although it is not certain exactly where the zoning boundaries for P.S. 194 would have been, a Columbia University social work student studying the All-Day Neighborhood School in 1945 wrote that they were 142&lt;span class=""s1""&gt;<sup>nd</sup>&lt;/span&gt; Street, 145th Street, Bradhurst Avenue, and Lenox Avenue. Much of Harlem, including this area, faced poverty and deteriorating housing conditions, which had worsened during the Great Depression. There was an especially high proportion of young people living in Harlem too, in need of academic and social opportunities. These demographics are illustrated through 1940 census data below, with the rectangle highlighting the potential boundaries for P.S. 194.</p>

HEADER The Beginning of the Experiment

"&lt;h3 style=""text-align: left;""&gt;The City-Wide Citizen's Committee on Harlem&lt;/h3&gt;
<p>In 1941 a group of advocates from across the city came together to form the City-Wide Citizens Committee on Harlem. Influenced by World War II, they felt that American democracy required civil rights and better race relations and that it was important to the war effort to improve conditions in Harlem. The committees members had a range of backgrounds, but most were well-known leaders and came from the middle or upper class. Many were moderate reformers, interested in using their influence to gain concessions from city government. The group was divided into sub-committees that addressed issues like housing, employment, health, crime, and education. Each had two co-chairs, one black and one white, whose experience matched the focus of that sub-committee. In May 1942, during the first ever ""Harlem Week,"" the committee released a series of reports with their recommendations.</p>

<p>&lt;img style=""text-align: left; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"" src="" http://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/files/original/1be710b18222a4ab5a94065568fb2871.JPG"" alt="" width="" height=""425"" /&gt;</p>
&lt;p style=""text-align: center;""&gt;<em>&lt;a href=""http://harlemeducationhistory.library.columbia.edu/collection/items/show/2585""&gt;Report of the City-Wide Citizens Committee on Harlem Sub-Committee on Education and Recreation, 1942&lt;/a&gt;</em></p>

<p>The Sub-Committee on Education and Recreation's report focused on deficiencies in Harlem's environment and population, calling it a ""problem area"" and discussing ""special treatment."" Like other education reformers in Harlem who neglected to name systemic inequalities or any discrimination in the schools, they connected Harlem's environment to its educational challenges. They did, however, advocate for a number of changes that would bring increased resources and opportunities to Harlem. Their recommendations echoed many of the demands that Harlem activists had been making: new schools and playgrounds, improvements to deteriorating buildings, and reductions in class sizes, among others. In line with trends in the 1940s, they also called for additional vocational high schools, teaching intercultural relations, and centralizing a system of psychological services for schools.

<p>ITEM 2641
CAPTION <p>City-Wide Citizen's Committee on Harlem Sub-Committee on Education and Recreation Report recommending the institution of P.S. 194 as an All-Day Neighborhood School, 1942</p>

&lt;h3 class=""p1""&gt;Bringing the All-Day Neighborhood School to Harlem&lt;/h3&gt;"

<p>The Sub-Committee <strong>recommended that P.S. 194 be designated an All-Day Neighborhood School</strong> (along with P.S. 157, which never occurred). This report is the earliest mention of bringing the All-Day Neighborhood Schools to Harlem, and it marked the official start to the Board of Education partnership and expansion of the program out of Chelsea. This recommendation is one of the few that had already been approved by the city and was ready to begin. In fact, it would start just four months later. Committee members connected the All-Day Neighborhood School back to the war, noting that the increase in working mothers would lead to unsupervised children and juvenile delinquency without a program like the All-Day Neighborhood School. They hoped that the program would be successful and would soon spread throughout Harlem.

<p>The report does not say how this recommendation came to be included, but it may have been through sub-committee chair Frank E. Karelson Jr., who was also the vice president of the Public Education Association. After a few years of sponsorship of the program at P.S. 33, the Public Education Association was working on expanding the All-Day Neighborhood Schools program and gaining the support of the Board of Education. Perhaps through Karelson's connection, P.S. 194 became the site of this new experiment. Although the program itself was created outside of the context of Harlem, framed within this 1942 call for change, its rhetoric around school and community brings up deep-seated tensions about how to support youth in Harlem. The City-Wide Citizens Committee on Harlem had started this significant change for P.S. 194, and teachers, staff, volunteers, parents, and students would influence it further in the years to come."

HEADER The Board of Education and the Public Education Association

<p>As in the examples above, the PEA addressed the first two issues through their strategy of advocacy; they wrote letters, spoke at hearings, and utilized their connections with sympathetic members of the Board to slowly make changes. In this document, the PEA's Committee for the All-Day Neighborhood Schools laid out their complaints about the third issue, the lack of publicity. By the closure of the program, they had never achieved the kind of partnership and support from the Board that they hoped to. Yet, because of the private funding that the PEA secured, they were able to supplement the basic structure the Board did provide and seek additional opportunities to share the program's success with New Yorkers and with other educators.
<p>&nbsp;</p>"

"&lt;h3 style=""text-align: left;""&gt;A Lack of Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style=""text-align: left;""&gt;Members of the Public Education Association felt that the Board of Education never fully gave the support that it promised. This tension characterized the partnership for its thirty years, even as they collaborated successfully. Complaints fell into three categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. The Board of Education moved too slowly in building out a management structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Hiring requirements prioritized those with higher education rather than those with experience in the All-Day Neighborhood Schools</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. The Board neglected to publicize the All-Day Neighborhood Schools</strong></p>
</blockquote>"

<p>In 1942, at the same time as it was extended to P.S. 194, the Board of Education took up the program, beginning a three year demonstration project in hopes of later expansion. In 1945 they approved the results of the experimentation period, and designated two new All-Day Neighborhood Schools. At their height, there would be fourteen All-Day Neighborhood Schools in New York City.</p>

<p>From that point on, the program officially ran jointly through the Board of Education and the Public Education Association. The Public Education Association focused on training, creating conferences for professional development, facilitating community input, and working with the citizens committees. They also supplied the funding for school social workers and applied for additional grants to support their schools. The Public Education Association paid Adele Franklin as director to oversee the whole program, but eventually the Board of Education brought her into their office. The Board also paid the salaries for the group teachers and clerks.&nbsp;The program operated out of the Board's Elementary Division. This page from the Division of Elementary Schools Handbook in 1963-1964 depicts the All-Day Neighborhood School central office and director within that structure.

<p>The Public Education Association Committee later absorbed the city-wide Citizens Committee for the All-Day Neighborhood Schools (though the Citizens Committee for P.S. 194 remained independent). They put a lot of effort into advocating for its schools, particularly with the Board of Education. They pushed for the program's expansion, and for its continued funding at times that the Board threatened budget cuts. These documents from the 1960s display some of that work. They show consistent communication between the institutions and a desire from the supporting committees to have a voice in the school system. The only evidence this voice was heard, a victory claimed by the committee, is that the program survived potential budget cuts throughout the 1960s."

"<h3>A Unique Partnership</h3>
<p>The organizational system for managing the All-Day Neighborhood Schools developed out of the way that the program grew in its early years. It was first established informally by parents from the private City and Country School with Dr. Adele Franklin, who worked with the principal of P.S. 33 to bring aspects of that school's progressive educational model to Chelsea. The group soon reached out to the Public Education Association to help fund the program. They agreed, and created a committee to work on expansion and to coordinate with the independent Citizens for the All-Day Neighborhood Schools.</p>"

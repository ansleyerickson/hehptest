I"£<p>HEADER Existing Opportunities for Harlem Youth</p>

<p>Harlem‚Äôs youth population needed strong schools as well as other ways to develop through play, learning, and community. Advocates for the All-Day Neighborhood Schools and other educational reforms in Harlem stressed the lack of recreational activities for youth and a concern that free time ‚Äúin the streets‚Äù led to crime and delinquency. While this may have been true for some children, there were a number of existing institutions in Harlem that already offered activities outside of school. Both formal and informal, these programs were envisioned and run by members of the Harlem community.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn <em>Race and Real Estate: Conflict and Cooperation in Harlem, 1890-1920</em>, Kevin McGruder argues that the establishment of educational and recreational spaces was one way that the emerging black community in Harlem was ‚Äú‚Äúseeking to form a community of some permanence that they hoped would thrive.‚Äù‚Äù In the early 20th century, Harlem residents established their own youth institutions in the face of exclusion from other New York City organizations. They believed that opportunities for youth in arts, athletics, and leadership activities would strengthen the entire community.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=‚Äù‚Äúp2‚Äù‚Äú&gt;Two of the first institutions to open in Harlem were the YMCA and the YWCA. Formed as branches of national organizations only open to white membership, these buildings were spaces for older youth, primarily serving as residences for young adults moving to Harlem from the South during the Great Migration. Over time, they also developed afterschool activities for children. At the YWCA on 137th Street, young girls could join Girl Reserves, similar to Girl Scouts, where they participated in activities designed to foster strong values and leadership. The building also served as a place where neighborhood children could drop by after school and participate in art projects, field trips, educational discussions, theater, and games. By 1938 the YWCA had 1,200 junior members.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=‚Äù‚Äúp2‚Äù‚Äú&gt;Harlem youth also participated in athletic activities. As early as 1900, private athletic clubs opened throughout Harlem, with basketball, track and field, and boxing groups. Members paid dues to join a team and competed regularly. For the most part, these institution were only opened to boys and young men. Basketball, in particular, flourished in Harlem with many opportunities for youth to play formally and informally after school and on the weekends. Beginning in 1947, Holcombe Rucker, a playground director from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation developed an extensive youth basketball program out of Harlem‚Äôs public parks and playgrounds. He set up teams and tournaments in the 1950s and 1960s. Rucker also mentored the youth he worked with and offered tutoring, alongside athletics.</p>

<p>&lt;p class=‚Äù‚Äúp2‚Äù‚Äú&gt;In addition to these community programs outside of the school, Harlem teachers and administrators created their own innovative programs within the public school system. At P.S. 24 on 128th Street, Principal Gertrude Ayer was a leader in the experimental activity program of the 1930s, which brought a progressive curriculum centering interdisciplinary projects, self-direction, and problem solving. Ayer created special opportunities at her school that welcomed in families, cared for them, and integrated the school into the community. Similarly, P.S. 89 on 135th Street served as a recreational and social center after school with clubs, classes, and meeting spaces. It became the Lenox Community Center, and was open to the community as well as to children from the school. In many ways, these initiatives mirrored aspects of the All-Day Neighborhood School program, but they were more a function of individual‚Äôs philosophies and dedication rather than a formalized program.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;p class=‚Äù‚Äúp2‚Äù‚Äú&gt;While these institutions, and others, offered varied opportunities for youth engagement outside of school, they had limited resources and could not be available to all children in Harlem. The All-Day Neighborhood School would bring another option for needed childcare and education. Yet by focusing on the school space, it ignored other community programs already a part of Harlem.&lt;/p&gt;‚Äù</p>

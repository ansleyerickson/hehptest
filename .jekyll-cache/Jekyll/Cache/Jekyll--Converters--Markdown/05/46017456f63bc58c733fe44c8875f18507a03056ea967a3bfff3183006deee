<p>Welcome! <em>Facets</em> is the second Jekyll theme for <a href="https://minicomp.github.io/wax/">Wax sites</a>. <em>Facets</em> allows users to browse through a collection using facets, or filters. When we are browsing through a collection of cultural artifacts, we often want to reduce the number of objects in front of us to a small collection that fits a very specific criteria. Faceted browsing is a form of browsing that allows you to do just that using filters you select. In Facets this can be achieved using drop-down menus where you can select the categories you want to browse by.</p>

<p>This template is open source. To use it for your small collection and exhibit simply replace our content with yours. To learn more visit our <a href="/hehp/about/">‚ÄúAbout‚Äù</a> page and our <a href="/hehp/learning/">‚ÄúHow to‚Äù</a> page. If you know what you‚Äôre doing, and you‚Äôre ready to jump right in, then go ahead and‚Ä¶</p>
